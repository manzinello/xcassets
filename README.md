# ðŸ“² xcassets

Generate **xcassets** resources for your iOS application

**THIS PACKAGE IS WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Getting started

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/xcassets.png?compact=true)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xcassets)

## Generate xcassets

At the moment the package is **WORK IN PROGRESS**, but you can install it and generate `AppIcon.appiconset` in the correct `Images.xcassets` running the command

```
xcassets
```

in a folder with an `appIcon.png` file (at least **1024x1024**!). This command will create `Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` with all the resources that you can import in your app in XCode.
